    "The average sum of these trials of 10 coin flips that start with the first 5 flips landing on heads actually seems to converge to 5 rather than 0, like we origanlly expected. This makes more sense because each coin flip is independantly probable to be 50% chance Heads and 50% chance Tails, not dependant upon the fact that the first five flips were all Heads so the second five flips would have to be tails. Therefore, we can't assume that the sum of the second set of 5 flips is = -5 but rather closer to 0 because each flip is independantly 50/50 chance heads/tails. So it would make sense that with an initial sum of 5, the variance from there out is 50/50 and closer to an average sum of X = 0 for the second set of 5 flips, and a total average sum of X = 5 for the total 10 flips."
